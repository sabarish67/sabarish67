I am Sabarish R. I am a Data Science Aspirant  I graduated from Sethu Institute of Technology in 2018 with a 69% (B.Tech Information Technology). 
My aim after leaving college was to prepare for government exams and get a job by clearing UPSC exams. I tried my level best and I was not able to clear the exams. 
After that, during the COVID-19 Lockdown, I took a few online courses related to IT. and in the year 2022 , came to know about GUVI and started to learn the DATA Science course from GUVI-IIT Madras. I am now waiting to get a job in the data science field.
